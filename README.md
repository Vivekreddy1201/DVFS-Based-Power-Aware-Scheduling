DVFS-Based Power-Aware Scheduling in Cloud Computing
📖 Overview

This project implements a DVFS-based power-aware scheduling simulation for cloud computing environments.
The goal is to reduce energy consumption in cloud datacenters while maintaining task execution efficiency and SLA compliance.

The simulation dynamically adjusts CPU frequency using Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling (DVFS) based on VM utilization and predicted workload. It also performs VM consolidation by transitioning underutilized virtual machines into a sleep state and reactivating them when needed.

Simulation Summary with Energy Savings

🧠 Scheduling Strategy

CPU frequency is adjusted dynamically:

High utilization → High frequency

Medium utilization → Medium frequency

Low utilization → Low frequency

Underutilized VMs are consolidated into sleep mode

Sleeping VMs are reactivated when task demand increases

Energy usage is compared against a baseline (fixed frequency) model
